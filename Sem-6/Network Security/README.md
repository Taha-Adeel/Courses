## Exploring HTTP Request Smuggling Attacks
* In this [project](HTTPS%20Smuggling%20Attacks%20Project/), we explore the concept of HTTP Request Smuggling and how it can be used to bypass security measures and perform attacks on web servers. 
* We simulate these attacks and their mitigation measures in sandboxed environments and analyze the results, which can be viewed [here](HTTPS%20Smuggling%20Attacks%20Project/results/).
* A comprehensive report on the project can be found [here](HTTPS%20Smuggling%20Attacks%20Project/documentation/report.pdf).
