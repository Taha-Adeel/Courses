Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Program is complete. We assume that all chess moves given to the parser are valid, as we dont check for the validity of the moves.

Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
We define substitution rules for the peices, rows and columns in the definition section.
Then in the rules section, we write a pattern to match to a move(and also patterns to match the s. no and whitespaces), and when this pattern is matched, we make the changes to the global variable board(2D array) which hold our configuration.
Then when the program ends, yywrap is called and we display our board.
