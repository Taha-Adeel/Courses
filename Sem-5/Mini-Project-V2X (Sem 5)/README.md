# Anonymous Authentication with Revocation for V2X

Research project under [Dr. Maria Francis](https://www.iith.ac.in/cse/mariaf/) in Fall 2022 at IIT Hyderabad, focusing on the challenging problem of revocation in anonymous authentication for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. 

## My Contribution
- My work builds on the Anonymous Authentication and Encryption Scheme proposed by Kanchan, and adds anonymous revocation to it by integrating and adapting the PEREA scheme into it. 
- The proposed lightweight solution uses dynamic accumulators and membership witnesses to revoke misbehaving vehicles.
- The user has to prove in zero-knowledge that the last K tickets in its queue havenâ€™t been blacklisted by the Issuing Authority.
