Instructions to run:

# Instructions to run, such as list of commands, or script, or Makefile

Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Incomplete. The grammar rules and actions are incomplete. The constructor for a class imports the member variables from its parents.
Then once the class signatures are obtained, they can be added to the documentation.


P2: Bhai-lang
----------------------------------------
Instructions to run:
# Instructions to run, such as list of commands, or script, or Makefile
cd p2
make
./p2.out Eaxample-1/input.bhai

Assumptions / Comments (if any):
The transcription is done by the lexer alone. Hence the main function is in the lexer
The executable can take input from stdin or from the filename given as argument while executing.
The transcribed python code is outputted into "out.py"

# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Yes the program is mostly complete.
Assumptions:
	The tokens are single spaced. To account for any amount spacing, we can replace the spaces in the lexer rules with [ \t]+, but that would bloat the rules.
	Also it is assummed that the input is a valid syntactically correct code.
	Assumes that the input contains only ascii characters


P3: Tic-tac-toe
---------
Instructions to run:
# Instructions to run, such as list of commands, or script, or Makefile
cd p3
make
./p3.out

Assumptions / Comments (if any):
The program takes input from stdin. To finish the scanning and print the result, press ctrl+D (==EOF signal)
The input can be taken directly without using the parser or lexer, but appropriate patterns and rules have been provided to parse the input.
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Yes the program is complete.
Assumptions:
	Input is correct, N >= 1, input is read till EOF
