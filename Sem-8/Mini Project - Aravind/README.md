# Exact Exponential Algorithms for MATCHING CUT

Research project under the guidance of [Dr. NR Aravind](https://www.iith.ac.in/cse/aravind/) in Spring 2024 at IIT Hyderabad.

## Problem Statement
- Understand and analyse the different existing exponential algorithmic techniques.
- Study the PPSZ algorithm for solving the k-SAT problem.
- Attempt to improve the current best known time complexity upper bound for the Matching Cut problem.
